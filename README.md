# Instacart Basket Analysis
This project delves into Instacart's historical data to reveal insights about consumer purchasing trends and the frequency of sales for different products.

## Objective
The aim of the analysis is to extract insights for future sales and marketing strategies including answering the following key questions.
- What the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders
- Segment products according to price range to create price range groupings to help direct their efforts
- Identify the most popular types of products
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
